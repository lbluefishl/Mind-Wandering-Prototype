                Incubation periods are implicated in fostering greater creativity. That is, if one is allowed to brood on a topic after a break period, creative insights or 'aha' moments will occur with greater frequency. Mind-wandering may mediate creativity through multiple routes. Past experiments have shown that a low working memory condition fosters the most creative incubation, even more so than rest periods.
<br><br>
                We test this hypothesis by presenting the alternative uses test to participants. After a break period, we study differences in creative uses of a particular object. Participants are randomly assigned to a low working memory group (choice reaction task) versus a hypothesized high working memory group with reduced mind-wandering (technology-available group).

            <h2>
                Mind-wandering has been suggested to promote social skills, moral reasoning, understanding emotions, and simulating other perspectives. These variables are important to interpret and process cyberbuylling experiences. By mentally stimulating cyberbullying events, participants can correctly appraise the situation deeply and respond accordingly. 
<br><br>
                We test the hypothesis that mind-wandering fosters beneficial reactions to cyberbullying events by presenting ficticious cyberbuylling incidents. We intersperse a break period in which participants are either assigned to a low working memory task (choice reaction task) or a high working memory task (technology-available group). Individuals assigned to the technology-avaialable group will be engaged in digital applications which reduce mind-wandering events and associated background processing of the cyberbullying event.

            <h2>
                When in relationships, individuals may post pictures of their significant other without the other's permission. Privacy violations of co-owned information (intimate pictures) occur frequently on social media. Individuals may make quick decisions without consulting their partners and understanding the others' perspective.

            
<br><br>
                Individuals may be able to better appraise the situation before posting pictures if they can mentally simulate their partner's reactions to their posts. We suggest that mind-wandering may be an important factor in determining proper decision making. Mind-wandering allows for the appraisal of future emotional responses to actions and understanding the perspective of their partner.

                <br><br>
                We test the hypothesis that mind-wandering facilitates better decision making that takes into account the privacy concerns of couples by presenting pictures to participants. Participants will be given a break period in either a low working memory task (choice reaction task) or a high working memory task (technology-available group). We suggest that individuals in the technology group mind-wander less and therefore process the implications of posting pictures less.

            <h2>
                Humans make thousands of decisions every day and must remember a myriad of background tasks, from watering the plants to studying for a test. These background tasks and goals often become salient during mind-wandering episodes. Mind-wandering therefore refreshes tasks and encodes them into long-term memory. A reduction in mind-wandering reduces attentional cycling, the ability to cycle through multiple task and mental representations.
                <br><br>
                We suggest that engaging digital technologies reduce mind-wandering by displacing attention. We hypothesize that individuals are less likely to remember a background task when given the option to use technology. We test this through a prospective memory task. Participants must remember to do a certain action in the future while attending to a primary task. We provide a break period in which the user is assigned to a low working memory task which fosters mind-wandering or a high working memory group (technology-available group). Participants with access to technology will likely perform the prospective memory task less, in line with similar studies.
