                Incubation periods are implicated in fostering greater creativity. That is, if one is allowed to brood on a topic after a break period, creative insights or 'aha' moments will occur with greater frequency. Mind-wandering may mediate creativity through multiple routes. Past experiments have shown that a low working memory condition fosters the most creative incubation, even more so than rest periods.
<br><br>
                We test this hypothesis by presenting the alternative uses test to participants. After a break period, we study differences in creative uses of a particular object. Participants are randomly assigned to a low working memory group (choice reaction task) versus a hypothesized high working memory group with reduced mind-wandering (technology-available group).

            <h2>
                Mind-wandering has been suggested to promote social skills, moral reasoning, understanding emotions, and simulating other perspectives. These variables are important to interpret and process cyberbuylling experiences. By mentally stimulating cyberbullying events, participants can correctly appraise the situation deeply and respond accordingly. 
<br><br>
                We test the hypothesis that mind-wandering fosters beneficial reactions to cyberbullying events by presenting ficticious cyberbuylling incidents. We intersperse a break period in which participants are either assigned to a low working memory task (choice reaction task) or a high working memory task (technology-available group). Individuals assigned to the technology-avaialable group will be engaged in digital applications which reduce mind-wandering events and associated background processing of the cyberbullying event.

            <h2>
                When in relationships, individuals may post pictures of their significant other without the other's permission. Privacy violations of co-owned information (intimate pictures) occur frequently on social media. Individuals may make quick decisions without consulting their partners and understanding the other's perspective.

            
<br><br>
                Individuals may be able to better appraise the situation before posting pictures if they can mentally simulate their partner's reactions to their posts. We suggest that mind-wandering may be an important factor in determining proper decision making. Mind-wandering allows for the appraisal of future emotional responses to actions and understanding the perspective of one's partner.

                <br><br>
                We test the hypothesis that mind-wandering facilitates better decision making that takes into account the privacy concerns of couples by presenting pictures to participants. Participants will be given a break period in either a low working memory task (choice reaction task) or a high working memory task (technology-available group). We suggest that individuals in the technology group mind-wander less and therefore process the implications of posting pictures less.

            <h2>
                Humans make thousands of decisions every day and must remember a myriad of background tasks, from watering the plants to studying for a test. These background tasks and goals often become salient during mind-wandering episodes. Mind-wandering therefore refreshes tasks and encodes them into long-term memory. A reduction in mind-wandering reduces attentional cycling, the ability to cycle through multiple task and mental representations.
                <br><br>
                We suggest that engaging digital technologies reduce mind-wandering by displacing attention. We hypothesize that individuals are less likely to remember a background task when given the option to use technology. We test this through a prospective memory task. Participants must remember to do a certain action in the future while attending to a primary task. We provide a break period in which the user is assigned to a low working memory task which fosters mind-wandering or a high working memory group (technology-available group). Participants with access to technology will likely perform the prospective memory task less, in line with similar studies.

                In education settings, it is important to provide options for interleaved learning for proper encoding and processing of information. That is, students should be provided breaks in between learning tasks. However, it is not well understood whether using engaging technology, such as video games or social media, is suitable for break periods. On one hand, these applications likely reduce boredom. A trade-off is that cognitive resources are typically maximally engaged during these periods, calling into question whether these break leads to a restoration of cognitive resources. Likewise, it is important to investigate whether the absense of mind-wandering in these highly engaging moments leads to impairments in background processing and encoding, especially in regards to learning.

   

                <br><br>
                We investigate this by setting up a learning task. We test participant's comprehension and abstract reasoning through selected SAT verbal passages. The SAT is a standardized test given to high school students in the United States, widely used as a factor for college admission. We hypothesize higher scores for individuals given a break in a low working memory task compared to a group given access to technology during a break.

            <h2>
            When dealing with rapidly shifting and changing information online, users often use heuristics in decision making and appraisal. Heuristics allow for a 'just good enough' approach that often works in the majority of situations. However, the quick and associative processes used for heuristics often comes at a cost when closer inspection is required. Misinformation online may target these vulnerabilities, exploiting system 1 (fast, associative, reflexive) processes.
<br><br>
                Mind-wandering may allow for the subtle processing of information behind the scenes. Dishabituation from the current mental schemas during exposure to misinformation may allow flexible recombinination of mental representations which lead to critical reflection on information. This processing is not explicit but works behind the scenes. We test this by presenting controversial TikTok videos to participants. We hypothesize that individuals allowed to mind-wander in the low working memory group will scrutinize information more so than those not allowed to mind-wander.
